# This is the README file of the second project regarding the Udacity's Professional Front-End Web Development track.

# let's know a key-brief about this project

# Project Name:
Weather-Journal App Project

# Project Description:
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

# Technologies that used:
1- HTML
2- CSS
3- JavaScript
4- Node.js

# Dependencies:
1- Express
2- Body-Parser
3- CORS
4- nodemon

# Project specifications and instructions (the project rubric categorized the specifications into three categories): 

## The Specification of Project Environment Setup
1- Node and Express should be installed on the local machine. 
2- The Express app instance should be pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files.
3- installing dependencies using npm.
4- make app instance and include all dependencies in `server.js`
5- create a local server and make it listening to a local port and send feedback through a working callback function.
6- Create API credentials to get the API key on `OpenWeatherMap.com`

## APIs and create Routes (asyncronously)
1- create a JavaScript Object named `projectData`to act as the app API endpoint.
2- store the API Key for OpenWeatherMap API in a golbal variable which wiil be passed as a parameter to fetch().
3- fetch API to get the data from API
4- create post route to post the API fetched data to the server endpoint
5 create get route to fetch data from the endpoit of server.
6- use the fetched data to update the UI dynamically.

## Dynamic UI (asyncronously)
1- Naming HTML Inputs and Buttons For Interaction
2- Assigning Element Properties Dynamically for date, temp & feelings. (user inputs)
3- Adds an event listener to an existing HTML button from DOM using Vanilla JS.
4- Sets the properties of existing HTML elements from the DOM using Vanilla JavaScript.
